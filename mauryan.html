<h2>Mauryan Sculpture</h2>
<p>Mauryan art is the art produced during the period of the Mauryan Empire, which was the first empire to rule over most of the Indian subcontinent, between 322 and 185 BCE.

Pillars, Stupas, caves are the most prominent survivals.</p>

<h2>The Great Stupas</h2>
<p>The 'Great Stupa' at Sanchi is the oldest stone structure in ancient India and was originally built by the emperor Ashoka the Great in the 3rd century BCE. Its nucleus was a simple hemispherical brick structure built over the relics of the Mahamodglyan and Mogliputt tiss the great buddhist monks . It was crowned by the chatra, a parasol-like structure symbolising high rank, which was intended to honour and shelter the relics. It has four profusely carved ornamental gateways and a balustrade encircling the whole structure.The sculptures had Greek influence.</p>
